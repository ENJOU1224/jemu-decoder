# How to contribute

English | [中文](./contribute.zh.md)

**Thank you for looking into contribute guide!**

If you want to help build the content,
`arch/riscv*` is the place to go.

Before start writing your first pull request,
you may want to get familiar with:

1. Project Structure - available in [README](../README.md)
1. Instruction Definition - details [here](./define.md)
1. Instruction Doc Format - details [here](./doc-instruction.md)

At this moment, we only have plan to support RISC-V ISA.
Therefore, all pull requests can be directly targeted to branch `master`.

> #### Hint
> 
> It is not a bad idea to use _github embedded editor_ to create pull requests for single-file changes
